abstract = {We introduce the Information Systems Ontology (ISO), a new ontology for the Information Systems (IS) discipline designed to enable automated knowledge synthesis and meta-analysis of research findings in IS. We constructed ISO in a methodical manner, following known best practices for ontology construction. We also conducted a series of ontology refinement steps in which we compared and extended ISO by extracting and examining both overlapping and missing key phrases from scientific articles and existing classification schemas. To evaluate ISO, we extracted author-defined keywords from more than 7,000 articles of the senior scholars’ basket of journals and measured terminological coverage. In one experiment, we found that our ontology included 3.6 times more author-defined keywords than an established classification schema for IS. In the future, we plan to use ISO to automatically annotate important IS terms and concepts in IS articles to help synthesize and analyze knowledge in IS.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
